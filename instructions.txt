Below is a comprehensive description and architectural layout for the solution that uses Crawl4AI for the web scraping component. This design integrates a landing page for URL input with a backend that leverages Crawl4AI to extract clean, LLM-friendly content, which is then passed to a language model for partner evaluation.

---

### 1. Overview

**Goal:**  
The program accepts a website URL from a user, validates the input, and then uses Crawl4AI to crawl and extract the site's content in a clean Markdown (and optionally structured JSON) format. This scraped data is sent to a Large Language Model (LLM) via an API call to determine whether the website qualifies as a potential partner for a SaaS accessibility solutions company.

**Key Features:**

- **LLM-Friendly Scraping:**  
  Crawl4AI transforms the raw HTML into structured Markdown and JSON, reducing noise (such as headers, footers, and ads) and making it easier for LLMs to process the content.

- **Advanced Extraction:**  
  The solution supports both traditional (CSS/XPath-based) and LLM-based extraction strategies, ensuring flexibility for various website structures.

- **Scalable and Open Source:**  
  Being open source and containerized (via Docker), Crawl4AI enables efficient, real-time crawling without vendor lock-in.

- **End-to-End Workflow:**  
  A user-friendly landing page collects the URL, while the backend handles URL validation, invokes Crawl4AI for scraping, and then communicates with an LLM to output a partner probability assessment.

### 3. Detailed Component Description

- **Frontend (Landing Page):**  
  - **index.html:** Contains a text box for the user to enter a URL and a button labeled “Predict Partner Probability.”  
  - **main.js:** Listens for the button click, reads the URL from the text box, and sends an AJAX request to the backend `/predict` endpoint.

- **Backend (API Server):**  
  - **app.py:**  
    - Sets up routes:  
      - `/` renders the landing page.  
      - `/predict` accepts the URL (via POST or JSON), validates it, and orchestrates the scraping and LLM evaluation workflow.
    - Calls utility functions in `utils/url_validation.py`, `utils/crawl4ai_integration.py`, and `utils/llm_integration.py`.

- **URL Validation:**  
  - **url_validation.py:** Implements a function (e.g., `validate_url(url: str) -> bool`) to ensure the URL is correctly formatted, handling edge cases like missing protocols.

- **Scraping with Crawl4AI:**  
  - **crawl4ai_integration.py:**  
    - Uses the Crawl4AI Python library (installed via pip) to crawl the provided URL.  
    - Extracts the content in Markdown and/or JSON format, leveraging Crawl4AI’s advanced content filtering and extraction strategies.
    - Example usage:
      ```python
      from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

      async def scrape_content(url: str) -> str:
          async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
              result = await crawler.arun(url=url)
              return result.markdown  # or result.extracted_content for JSON
      ```

- **LLM Integration:**  
  - **llm_integration.py:**  
    - Constructs a prompt using the scraped content (e.g., asking whether the content indicates a potential partner like a marketing agency or digital service provider).  
    - Sends the prompt to an LLM API (such as OpenAI's GPT-4) and parses the response to extract a partner probability along with any additional insights.
    - Example usage:
      ```python
      import openai

      def evaluate_partner(content: str) -> dict:
          prompt = f"Based on the following website content, determine if this site is a potential partner for a SaaS accessibility solutions company. Provide a partner probability (0-100) and brief reasoning:\n\n{content}"
          response = openai.Completion.create(
              model="gpt-4",
              prompt=prompt,
              max_tokens=150,
              temperature=0.5
          )
          return {"partner_probability": response.choices[0].text.strip()}
      ```

### 4. Execution Flow Recap

1. **User Input:**  
   The user enters a URL on the landing page and clicks the “Predict Partner Probability” button.

2. **AJAX Request:**  
   JavaScript sends the URL to the backend endpoint (`/predict`).

3. **Backend Processing:**  
   - The URL is validated.
   - The backend calls the Crawl4AI integration to scrape the website.
   - The scraped content is then passed to the LLM integration for partner evaluation.

4. **Result Display:**  
   The LLM’s response (indicating partner probability and reasoning) is returned as JSON and rendered on the landing page.
